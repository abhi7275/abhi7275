üîç Driving Business Decisions with Data, Experiments, and Scalable Analytics

As a Data Scientist at TCS (R&D), I work at the intersection of customer insights, experimentation, and scalable analytics. My focus is on building systems that turn messy, real-world data into actionable insights ‚Äî from call center sentiment to product engagement metrics.

üéØ Highlights of My Work:
‚Ä¢ Automated Sentiment Analysis: Designed a system analyzing 250K+ customer interactions daily using NLP models (TF-IDF + XGBoost), replacing manual surveys and informing credit operations across 20+ countries.
‚Ä¢ KPI-Driven Dashboards: Partnered with product and ops teams to define key metrics and build dashboards that track agent performance and customer satisfaction.
‚Ä¢ A/B Testing & Forecasting: Led multilingual experiments to improve model accuracy in LATAM regions and deployed time-series anomaly detection (Prophet) to flag drops in satisfaction before they became escalations.
‚Ä¢ End-to-End Analytics: From ETL in Spark/Python to visualization in QuickSight and Streamlit ‚Äî I‚Äôve worked across the stack to support timely, data-informed decisions.

I enjoy working on real-world problems where analytics meet product thinking. Looking forward to roles that blend experimentation, stakeholder collaboration, and impactful storytelling through data.
